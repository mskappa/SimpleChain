I made this simple iOS application to better understand the blockchain data structure.

I have started this project thanks to a super clear article about blockchain that can be founded [here] . The code in that article is written in python and i have decided to make a translation in swift for edu purpose.

I also implemented a simple **proof of work** function with fixed **difficulty** i used this [article] to understand how proof-of-work is achieved.

The most important classes of the project are the **Block Class** and the **Blockchain Class** the rest of the application is just related to UI.


Enjoy : )
